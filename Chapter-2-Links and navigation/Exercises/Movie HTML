		  <h2>Plot:</h2>
		  <hr>
		  <p>J. Jonah Jameson of The Daily Bugle has exposed Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man to the world, while simultaneously framing him as the 
		  individual responsible for Mysterio's death and an alleged mass casualty event in London. Numerous civilians nearby begin to
		  surround him and Michelle Jones, forcing them to flee from the media and the police. They hide in Parker's apartment and 
		  reunite with May Parker and Happy Hogan, who reveal that they have broken up. Not long after, the United States Department
		  of Damage Control take them along with Ned Leeds in their custody for interrogation. Parker hires Matt Murdock to represent
		  him, who manages to get his criminal charges dropped. However, as Parker, Jones, and Leeds return to Midtown High for their 
		  senior year, the intense controversy causes them to be rejected from every college they apply to, including MIT.</p>
		  <p>Parker visits the New York Sanctum and asks Doctor Strange to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more to get his
		  friends into MIT. Despite being warned by Wong not to, Strange attempts to cast the spell with the Runes of Kof-Kol. However, 
		  Parker incessantly alters the spell when requesting various individuals close to him to be exempt from its effects. As a result,
		  the spell becomes unstable, forcing Strange to contain it. For not consulting with college administrators before meeting with him,
		  Strange furiously kicks Parker out of the Sanctum. Contacting Flash Thompson, who was admitted to MIT, Parker is led to an administrator 
		  heading to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge in an attempt to appeal his, Jones' and Leeds' applications.</p>
